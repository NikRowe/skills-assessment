## 14four Skills Assessment

This assessment is supposed to take about 3-4 hours using HTML/CSS/JS with specific instructions not to over use JS, and not to use libraries such as bootstrap or jquery. The assignment took me about 25hours in total, quite a bit longer than the expected time frame. 

My Biggest Hurdles: 
<li>Taking the correct approach </li>
<li>Learning CSS Grid from scratch</li>
<li>Prioritizing sleep and time</li>
<br>

I had almost solely used Bootstrap during my boot camp for styling projects, and other libraries such as Reactstrap/MaterializeCSS during personal projects. So the first thing I had to do was dive into the CSS Grid docs and set up a layout. 
Then I needed to populate the data & style it further. Simple enough... 

I believe it took me quite a bit longer because I have been focusing solely on JS exorcises for the past 23 days following a 30day series, having my mind so JS orientated I ended up attempting to use JS for 90% of the assignment despite the instructions. <br>
While I learned quite a bit such as diving into event delegation to get the event listeners to persist working after switching the selector between phone/email. (This is primarily done in jquery so I then had to find a way to convert the jquery to vanilla js per instructions not to use jquery.) Ultimately it took too many hours and I still was not getting it 100% there. <br>
I was excited to have the opportunity to take the assessment test as a very new jr. Dev, I started the assessment at 8:30pm on a wednesday and stayed up the entire night logging off at 5:30am to head to my day job. This ended up being a big mistake and I believe cost me more hours than I thought I was gaining by staying up due to not thinking as clearly from lack of sleep. <br>
Friday night I got some actual rest and woke up Saturday refreshed and things started clicking! <br><i>"Listen to the instructions and what they are almost hinting at.." </i><br> I said to myself. <br> 
I was most likely expected to run into issues with heavy a JS loaded approach as a jr Dev. I needed to use CSS that wasn't being reset by the selector. 

An almost complete re-code of the project and a few hours later I had it solved!!!

I have included the "htmlOG" file just so that anyone can see what I was attempting via my JS approach.
